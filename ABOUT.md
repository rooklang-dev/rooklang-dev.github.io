# rooklang
Rook is a programming language, which is a WIP and to be written in various different languages.

> I am not activly developing it so it might take a while.

# Current Plan:

1. Write a compiler for it named `rookc` in various languages. Make it
   compile into native binary or cross-compile for various platforms.
2. Write a standard library for the language. 
3. Write an Interpreter if possible.
4. Add more utilities.

## Distributions of Rook:
  1. Java
  2. Rust
  3. Python (not decided)
  4. C++ (not decided)
# Goals / TODOs

1. Execute the current plan.
2. Build a github page.
3. Write an wiki (probably).
